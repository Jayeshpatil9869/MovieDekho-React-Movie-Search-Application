# MovieSearch – React + Vite

This project provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and ESLint configurations.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

* [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) – uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
* [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) – uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

---

## 📌 Expanding ESLint Configuration

For production-level apps, we recommend using **TypeScript** and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate `typescript-eslint`.
